## General Information
- This project builds a multiple linear regression model to predict the number of bike rentals per day for a U.S.-based shared bike service, BoomBikes.
- The business problem is to identify key factors that influence demand and use them to forecast future rental needs, especially in a post-pandemic scenario.
- The dataset used is `download.csv`, which includes variables like temperature, humidity, season, weekday, weather situation, and actual rental counts.

## Conclusions
- The final model includes 16 statistically significant variables and achieved an R-squared of **0.8573** on the test set.
- Variables such as **year, temperature, working days**, and **weather conditions** have the most impact on demand.
- The model generalizes well and passes residual checks including normality and constant variance assumptions.
- Insights from this model can help BoomBikes improve demand forecasting and operational planning.
